# Xamarin BOOT_COMPLETED Location for Android
An example how to implement a location service with BOOT_COMPLETED in Xamarin (word in progress)

## Requirements
The app is made with:
- Xamarin Forms 2.3.4.231 or above
- Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 23.3.0
- Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat 23.3.0
- Xamarin.Android.Support.Animated.Vector.Drawable 23.3.0

## Scenario
In my app I want to create a service to save constantly a device location. This service has to start when the phone is rebooted.

## Where you can start to understand
I have created a short post to explain key code http://www.puresourcecode.com/dotnet/post/Xamarin-Android-and-starting-a-service-at-device-boot
